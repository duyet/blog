Information Gain, like [Gini Impurity](/blog/gini-impurity/), is a metric used to train Decision Trees. Specifically, these metrics measure the **quality of a split**. For example, say we have the following data:

![The Dataset](./media-link/gini-impurity-post/dataset.svg)

What if we made a split at $$x = 1.5$$?

![An Imperfect Split](./media-link/gini-impurity-post/dataset-imperfect-split.svg)

This imperfect split breaks our dataset into these branches:

- Left branch, with 4 blues. <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point blue"></span>
- Right branch, with 1 blue and 5 greens. <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span>

It's clear this split isn't optimal, but how good is it? **How can we _quantify_ the quality of a split?**

That's where Information Gain comes in.

## Information Entropy

Before we get to Information Gain, we have to first talk about [Information Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)). In the context of training Decision Trees, Entropy can be roughly thought of as **how much variance the data has**. For example:

- A dataset of only blues <span class="inline-point blue"></span><span class="inline-point blue"></span><span class="inline-point blue"></span><span class="inline-point blue"></span> would have very **low** (in fact, zero) entropy.
- A dataset of mixed blues, greens, and reds <span class="inline-point blue"></span><span class="inline-point blue"></span><span class="inline-point green"></span><span class="inline-point green"></span><span class="inline-point red"></span><span class="inline-point red"></span> would have relatively **high** entropy.

Here's how we calculate Information Entropy for a dataset with $C$ classes:

$$
E = -\sum_i^C p_i \log_2 p_i
$$

where $p_i$ is the probability of randomly picking an element of class $i$ (i.e. the proportion of the dataset made up of class $i$).

The easiest way to understand this is with an example. Consider a dataset with 1 blue, 2 greens, and 3 reds: <span class="inline-point blue"></span><span class="inline-point green"></span><span class="inline-point green"></span><span class="inline-point red"></span><span class="inline-point red"></span><span class="inline-point red"></span>. Then

$$
E = -(p_b \log_2 p_b + p_g \log_2 p_g + p_r \log_2 p_r)
$$

We know $p_b = \frac{1}{6}$ because $\frac{1}{6}$ of the dataset is blue. Similarly, $p_g = \frac{2}{6}$ (greens) and $p_r = \frac{3}{6}$ (reds). Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
E &= -(\frac{1}{6} \log_2(\frac{1}{6}) + \frac{2}{6} \log_2(\frac{2}{6}) + \frac{3}{6} \log_2(\frac{3}{6})) \\
&= \boxed{1.46} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

What about a dataset of all one color? Consider 3 blues as an example: <span class="inline-point blue"></span><span class="inline-point blue"></span><span class="inline-point blue"></span>. The entropy would be

$$
E = -(1 \log_2 1) = \boxed{0}
$$

## Information Gain

It's finally time to answer the question we posed earlier: **how can we quantify the quality of a split?**

Let's consider this split again:

![An Imperfect Split](./media-link/gini-impurity-post/dataset-imperfect-split.svg)

_Before_ the split, we had 5 blues and 5 greens, so the entropy was

$$
\begin{aligned}
E_{before} &= -(0.5 \log_2 0.5 + 0.5 \log_2 0.5) \\
&= \boxed{1} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

After the split, we have two branches.

Left Branch has 4 blues, so $E_{left} = \boxed{0}$ because it's a dataset of all one color.

Right Branch has 1 blue and 5 greens, so

$$
\begin{aligned}
E_{right} &= -(\frac{1}{6} \log_2 (\frac{1}{6}) + \frac{5}{6} \log_2 (\frac{5}{6})) \\
&= \boxed{0.65} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Now that we have the entropies for both branches, we can determine the quality of the split by **weighting the entropy of each branch by how many elements it has**. Since Left Branch has 4 elements and Right Branch has 6, we weight them by $0.4$ and $0.6$, respectively:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E_{split} &= 0.4 * 0 + 0.6 * 0.65 \\
&= \boxed{0.39} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

We started with $E_{before} = 1$ entropy before the split and now are down to $0.39$! **Information Gain = how much Entropy we removed**, so

$$
\text{Gain} = 1 - 0.39 = \boxed{0.61}
$$

This makes sense: **higher Information Gain = more Entropy removed**, which is what we want. In the perfect case, each branch would contain only one color after the split, which would be zero entropy!

## Recap

**Information Entropy** can be thought of as how how unpredictable a dataset is.

- A set of only one class (say, blue <span class="inline-point blue"></span><span class="inline-point blue"></span><span class="inline-point blue"></span>) is extremely predictable: anything in it is blue. This would have **low** entropy.
- A set of many mixed classes <span class="inline-point blue"></span><span class="inline-point green"></span><span class="inline-point red"></span> is unpredictable: a given element could be any color! This would have **high** entropy.

The actual formula for calculating Information Entropy is:

$$
E = -\sum_i^C p_i \log_2 p_i
$$

**Information Gain** is calculated for a split by subtracting the weighted entropies of each branch from the original entropy. When training a Decision Tree using these metrics, the best split is chosen by maximizing Information Gain.
