If you look at the documentation for the [DecisionTreeClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html) class in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), you'll see something like this for the `criterion` parameter:

![](./media-link/gini-impurity-post/scikit-learn.png)

The [RandomForestClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) documentation says the same thing. Both mention that the default criterion is "gini" for the **Gini Impurity**. What is that?!

> TLDR: Read the [Recap](#recap).

## Decision Trees üå≤

Training a decision tree consists of iteratively splitting the current data into two branches. Say we had the following datapoints:

![The Dataset](./media-link/gini-impurity-post/dataset.svg)

<style>
.inline-point {
  margin: 2px 1px;
  width: 8px;
  height: 8px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  display: inline-block;
}
.inline-point.blue {
  background-color: #164BC5;
}
.inline-point.green {
  background-color: #0F9640;
}
.inline-point.red {
  background-color: red;
}
</style>
Right now, we have 1 branch with 5 blues and 5 greens. <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span>

Let's make a split at $$x = 2$$:

![A Perfect Split](./media-link/gini-impurity-post/dataset-perfect-split.svg)

This is a **perfect** split! It breaks our dataset perfectly into two branches:

- Left branch, with 5 blues. <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point blue"></span>
- Right branch, with 5 greens. <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span>

What if we'd made a split at $$x = 1.5$$ instead?

![An Imperfect Split](./media-link/gini-impurity-post/dataset-imperfect-split.svg)

This imperfect split breaks our dataset into these branches:

- Left branch, with 4 blues. <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point blue"></span>
- Right branch, with 1 blue and 5 greens. <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span>

It's obvious that this split is worse, but **how can we quantify that?**

Being able to measure the quality of a split becomes even more important if we add a third class, reds <span class="inline-point red"></span>. Imagine the following split:

- Branch 1, with 3 blues, 1 green, and 1 red. <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point red"></span>
- Branch 2, with 3 greens and 1 red. <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point red"></span>

Compare that against this split:

- Branch 1, with 3 blues, 1 green, and 2 reds. <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point blue"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point red"></span> <span class="inline-point red"></span>
- Branch 2, with 3 greens. <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span> <span class="inline-point green"></span>

Which split is better? It's no longer immediately obvious. We need a way to **quantitatively evaluate** how good a split is.

## Gini Impurity

This is where the Gini Impurity metric comes in.

Suppose we

1. Randomly pick a datapoint in our dataset, then
2. **Randomly classify it according to the class distribution in the dataset**. For our dataset, we'd classify it as blue $\frac{5}{10}$ of the time and as green $\frac{5}{10}$ of the time, since we have 5 datapoints of each color.

**What's the probability we classify the datapoint incorrectly?** The answer to that question is the Gini Impurity.

### Example 1: The Whole Dataset

Let's calculate the Gini Impurity of our entire dataset. If we randomly pick a datapoint, it's either blue (50%) or green (50%).

Now, we randomly classify our datapoint according to the class distribution. Since we have 5 of each color, we classify it as blue 50% of the time and as green 50% of the time.

What's the probability we classify our datapoint **incorrectly**?

| Event | Probability |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Pick Blue, Classify Blue <span class="checkmark">‚úì</span> | 25% |
| Pick Blue, Classify Green ‚ùå | 25% |
| Pick Green, Classify Blue ‚ùå | 25% |
| Pick Green, Classify Green <span class="checkmark">‚úì</span> | 25% |

We only classify it incorrectly in 2 of the events above. Thus, our total probability is 25% + 25% = 50%, so the Gini Impurity is $\boxed{0.5}$.

### The Formula

If we have $C$ total classes and $p(i)$ is the probability of picking a datapoint with class $i$, then the Gini Impurity is calculated as

$$
G = \sum_{i=1}^C p(i) * (1 - p(i))
$$

For the example above, we have $C = 2$ and $p(1) = p(2) = 0.5$, so

$$
\begin{aligned}
G &= p(1) * (1 - p(1)) + p(2) * (1 - p(2)) \\
&= 0.5 * (1 - 0.5) + 0.5 * (1 - 0.5) \\
&= \boxed{0.5} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

which matches what we calculated!

### Example 2: A Perfect Split

Let's go back to the perfect split we had. What are the Gini Impurities of the two branches after the split?

![A Perfect Split](./media-link/gini-impurity-post/dataset-perfect-split.svg)

Left Branch has only blues, so its Gini Impurity is

$$
G_{left} = 1 * (1 - 1) + 0 * (1 - 0) = \boxed{0}
$$

Right Branch has only greens, so its Gini Impurity is

$$
G_{right} = 0 * (1 - 0) + 1 * (1 - 1) = \boxed{0}
$$

Both branches have $0$ impurity! The perfect split turned a dataset with $0.5$ impurity into 2 branches with $0$ impurity.

**A Gini Impurity of 0 is the lowest and best possible impurity**. It can only be achieved when everything is the same class (e.g. only blues or only greens).

### Example 3: An Imperfect Split

Finally, let's return to our imperfect split.

![An Imperfect Split](./media-link/gini-impurity-post/dataset-imperfect-split.svg)

Left Branch has only blues, so we know that $G_{left} = \boxed{0}$.

Right Branch has 1 blue and 5 greens, so

$$
\begin{aligned}
G_{right} &= \frac{1}{6} * (1 - \frac{1}{6}) + \frac{5}{6} * (1 - \frac{5}{6}) \\
&= \frac{5}{18} \\
&= \boxed{0.278} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Picking The Best Split

It's finally time to answer the question we posed earlier: **how can we quantitatively evaluate the quality of a split?**

Here's the imperfect split yet again:

![An Imperfect Split](./media-link/gini-impurity-post/dataset-imperfect-split.svg)

We've already calculated the Gini Impurities for:

- Before the split (the entire dataset): $0.5$
- Left Branch: $0$
- Right Branch: $0.278$

We'll determine the quality of the split by **weighting the impurity of each branch by how many elements it has**. Since Left Branch has 4 elements and Right Branch has 6, we get:

$$
(0.4 * 0) + (0.6 * 0.278) = 0.167
$$

Thus, the amount of impurity we've "removed" with this split is

$$
0.5 - 0.167 = \boxed{0.333}
$$

I'll call this value the Gini Gain. This is what's used to pick the best split in a decision tree! **Higher Gini Gain = Better Split**. For example, it's easy to verify that the Gini Gain of the perfect split on our dataset is $0.5 > 0.333$.

## Recap

**Gini Impurity** is the probability of _incorrectly_ classifying a randomly chosen element in the dataset if it were randomly labeled _according to the class distribution_ in the dataset. It's calculated as

$$
G = \sum_{i=1}^C p(i) * (1 - p(i))
$$

where $C$ is the number of classes and $p(i)$ is the probability of randomly picking an element of class $i$.

When training a decision tree, the best split is chosen by **maximizing the Gini Gain**, which is calculated by subtracting the weighted impurities of the branches from the original impurity.
