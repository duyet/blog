I had the privilege of joining [Adam Stacoviak](https://twitter.com/adamstac) and [Jerod Santo](https://twitter.com/jerodsanto) on an episode of [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/) recently to discuss the explosion of the .io game genre, as well as my experiences building and selling .io games like [generals.io](http://generals.io) and [geoarena.online](https://geoarena.online/). Check it out:

If you want to learn more about building .io games, I've written guides on this topic:

- [How to Build a Multiplayer (.io) Web Game, Part 1](/blog/build-an-io-game-part-1/), a deep dive into the client-side Javascript of an .io game.
- [How to Build a Multiplayer (.io) Web Game, Part 2](/blog/build-an-io-game-part-2/), a look into the backend server behind an .io game.
