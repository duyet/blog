It has become an operating system for Big Data, providing a rich ecosystem of tools and techniques that allow you to use a large cluster of relatively cheap commodity hardware to do computing at supercomputer scale. Two ideas from Google in 2003 and 2004 made Hadoop possible: a framework for distributed storage (The Google File System), which is implemented as HDFS in Hadoop, and a framework for distributed computing (MapReduce).</p>\n<p>These two ideas have been the prime drivers for the advent of scaling analytics, large scale machine learning, and other big data appliances for the last ten years! However, in technology terms, ten years is an incredibly long time, and there are some well-known limitations that exist, with MapReduce in particular. Notably, programming MapReduce is difficult. You have to chain Map and Reduce tasks together in multiple steps for most analytics. This has resulted in specialized systems for performing SQL-like computations or machine learning. Worse, MapReduce requires data to be serialized to disk between each step, which means that the I/O cost of a MapReduce job is high, making interactive analysis and iterative algorithms very expensive; and the thing is, almost all optimization and machine learning is iterative.</p>\n<p>To address these problems, Hadoop has been moving to a more general resource management framework for computation, YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator). YARN implements the next generation of MapReduce, but also allows applications to leverage distributed resources without having to compute with MapReduce. By generalizing the management of the cluster, research has moved toward generalizations of distributed computation, expanding the ideas first imagined in MapReduce.</p>\n<p>Spark is the first fast, general purpose distributed computing paradigm resulting from this shift and is gaining popularity rapidly. Spark extends the MapReduce model to support more types of computations using a functional programming paradigm, and it can cover a wide range of workflows that previously were implemented as specialized systems built on top of Hadoop. Spark uses in-memory caching to improve performance and, therefore, is fast enough to allow for interactive analysis (as though you were sitting on the Python interpreter, interacting with the cluster). Caching also improves the performance of iterative algorithms, which makes it great for data theoretic tasks, especially machine learning.</p>\n<p>In this post we will first discuss how to set up Spark to start easily performing analytics, either simply on your local machine or in a cluster on EC2. We then will explore Spark at an introductory level, moving towards an understanding of what Spark is and how it works (hopefully motivating further exploration). In the last two sections we will start to interact with Spark on the command line and then demo how to write a Spark application in Python and submit it to the cluster as a Spark job.</p>\n<h2 id=\"install-spark\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#install-spark\" aria-label=\"install spark permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Install Spark</h2>\n<p>Spark is pretty simple to set up and get running on your machine.

Code is written in a driver program which is lazily evaluated, and upon an action, the driver code is distributed across the cluster to be executed by workers on their partitions of the RDD. Results are then sent back to the driver for aggregation or compilation. Essentially the driver program creates one or more RDDs, applies operations to transform the RDD, then invokes some action on the transformed RDD.</p>\n<p>These steps are outlined as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Define one or more RDDs either through accessing data stored on disk (HDFS, Cassandra, HBase, Local Disk), parallelizing some collection in memory, transforming an existing RDD, or by caching or saving.</li>\n<li>Invoke operations on the RDD by passing closures (functions) to each element of the RDD. Spark offers over 80 high level operators beyond Map and Reduce.</li>\n<li>Use the resulting RDDs with actions (e.g. count, collect, save, etc.). Actions kick off the computing on the cluster.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When Spark runs a closure on a worker, any variables used in the closure are copied to that node, but are maintained within the local scope of that closure. Spark provides two types of shared variables that can be interacted with by all workers in a restricted fashion. Broadcast variables are distributed to all workers, but are read-only. Broadcast variables can be used as lookup tables or stopword lists. Accumulators are variables that workers can “add” to using associative operations and are typically used as counters.</p>\n<p>Spark applications are essentially the manipulation of RDDs through transformations and actions. Future posts will go into this in greater detail, but this understanding should be enough to execute the example programs below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"spark-execution\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#spark-execution\" aria-label=\"spark execution permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Spark Execution</h2>\n<p>A brief note on the execution of Spark. Essentially, Spark applications are run as independent sets of processes, coordinated by a SparkContext in a driver program. The context will connect to some cluster manager (e.g. YARN) which allocates system resources. Each worker in the cluster is managed by an executor, which is in turn managed by the SparkContext. The executor manages computation as well as storage and caching on each machine.</p>\n<p>What is important to note is that application code is sent from the driver to the executors, and the executors specify the context and the various tasks to be run. The executors communicate back and forth with the driver for data sharing or for interaction. Drivers are key participants in Spark jobs, and therefore, they should be on the same network as the cluster. This is different from Hadoop code, where you might submit a job from anywhere to the JobTracker, which then handles the execution on the cluster.</p>\n<p>Writing a Spark Application\nWriting Spark applications is similar to working with Spark in the interactive console. The API is the same. First, you need to get access to the SparkContext, which was automatically loaded for you by the pyspark application.</p>\n<p>A basic template for writing a Spark application in Python is as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">## Spark Application - execute with spark-submit\n\n## Imports\nfrom pyspark import SparkConf, SparkContext\n\n## Module Constants\nAPP_NAME = &quot;My Spark Application&quot;\n\n## Closure Functions\n\n## Main functionality\n\ndef main(sc):\n    pass\n\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\n    # Configure Spark\n    conf = SparkConf().setAppName(APP_NAME)\n    conf = conf.setMaster(&quot;local[*]&quot;)\n    sc   = SparkContext(conf=conf)\n\n    # Execute Main functionality\n    main(sc)</code></pre></div>\n<p>This template gives you a sense of what is needed in a Spark application: imports for various Python libraries, module constants, an identifying application name for debugging and for the Spark UI, closures or other custom operation functions, and finally, some main analytical methodology that is run as the driver. In our ifmain, we create the SparkContext and execute main with the context as configured. This will allow us to easily import driver code into the pyspark context without execution. Note that here a Spark configuration is hard coded into the SparkConf via the setMaster method, but typically you would just allow this value to be configured from the command line, so you will see this line commented out.</p>\n<p>To close or exit the program use sc.stop() or sys.exit(0).</p>\n<p>In order to demonstrate a common use of Spark, let’s take a look at a common use case where we read in a CSV file of data and compute some aggregate statistic. In this case, we’re looking at the on-time flight data set from the U.S. Department of Transportation, recording all U.S. domestic flight departure and arrival times along with their departure and arrival delays for the month of April, 2014. I typically use this data set because one month is manageable for exploration, but the entire data set needs to be computed upon with a cluster. The entire app is as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">## Spark Application - execute with spark-submit\n\n## Imports\nimport csv\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfrom StringIO import StringIO\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom operator import add, itemgetter\nfrom pyspark import SparkConf, SparkContext\n\n## Module Constants\nAPP_NAME = &quot;Flight Delay Analysis&quot;\nDATE_FMT = &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;\nTIME_FMT = &quot;%H%M&quot;\n\nfields   = (&#39;date&#39;, &#39;airline&#39;, &#39;flightnum&#39;, &#39;origin&#39;, &#39;dest&#39;, &#39;dep&#39;,\n            &#39;dep_delay&#39;, &#39;arv&#39;, &#39;arv_delay&#39;, &#39;airtime&#39;, &#39;distance&#39;)\nFlight   = namedtuple(&#39;Flight&#39;, fields)\n\n## Closure Functions\ndef parse(row):\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    Parses a row and returns a named tuple.\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n\n    row[0]  = datetime.strptime(row[0], DATE_FMT).date()\n    row[5]  = datetime.strptime(row[5], TIME_FMT).time()\n    row[6]  = float(row[6])\n    row[7]  = datetime.strptime(row[7], TIME_FMT).time()\n    row[8]  = float(row[8])\n    row[9]  = float(row[9])\n    row[10] = float(row[10])\n    return Flight(*row[:11])\n\ndef split(line):\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    Operator function for splitting a line with csv module\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    reader = csv.reader(StringIO(line))\n    return reader.next()\n\ndef plot(delays):\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    Show a bar chart of the total delay per airline\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    airlines = [d[0] for d in delays]\n    minutes  = [d[1] for d in delays]\n    index    = list(xrange(len(airlines)))\n\n    fig, axe = plt.subplots()\n    bars = axe.barh(index, minutes)\n\n    # Add the total minutes to the right\n    for idx, air, min in zip(index, airlines, minutes):\n        if min &gt; 0:\n            bars[idx].set_color(&#39;#d9230f&#39;)\n            axe.annotate(&quot; %0.0f min&quot; % min, xy=(min+1, idx+0.5), va=&#39;center&#39;)\n        else:\n            bars[idx].set_color(&#39;#469408&#39;)\n            axe.annotate(&quot; %0.0f min&quot; % min, xy=(10, idx+0.5), va=&#39;center&#39;)\n\n    # Set the ticks\n    ticks = plt.yticks([idx+ 0.5 for idx in index], airlines)\n    xt = plt.xticks()[0]\n    plt.xticks(xt, [&#39; &#39;] * len(xt))\n\n    # minimize chart junk\n    plt.grid(axis = &#39;x&#39;, color =&#39;white&#39;, linestyle=&#39;-&#39;)\n\n    plt.title(&#39;Total Minutes Delayed per Airline&#39;)\n    plt.show()\n\n## Main functionality\ndef main(sc):\n\n    # Load the airlines lookup dictionary\n    airlines = dict(sc.textFile(&quot;ontime/airlines.csv&quot;).map(split).collect())\n\n    # Broadcast the lookup dictionary to the cluster\n    airline_lookup = sc.broadcast(airlines)\n\n    # Read the CSV Data into an RDD\n    flights = sc.textFile(&quot;ontime/flights.csv&quot;).map(split).map(parse)\n\n    # Map the total delay to the airline (joined using the broadcast value)\n    delays  = flights.map(lambda f: (airline_lookup.value[f.airline],\n                                     add(f.dep_delay, f.arv_delay)))\n\n    # Reduce the total delay for the month to the airline\n    delays  = delays.reduceByKey(add).collect()\n    delays  = sorted(delays, key=itemgetter(1))\n\n    # Provide output from the driver\n    for d in delays:\n        print &quot;%0.0f minutes delayed\\t%s&quot; % (d[1], d[0])\n\n    # Show a bar chart of the delays\n    plot(delays)\n\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\n    # Configure Spark\n    conf = SparkConf().setMaster(&quot;local[*]&quot;)\n    conf = conf.setAppName(APP_NAME)\n    sc   = SparkContext(conf=conf)\n\n    # Execute Main functionality\n    main(sc)</code></pre></div>\n<p>To run this code (presuming that you have a directory called ontime with the two CSV files in the same directory), use the spark-submit command as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ spark-submit app.py</code></pre></div>\n<p>This will create a Spark job using the localhost as the master, and look for the two CSV files in an ontime directory that is in the same directory as app.py. The final result shows that the total delays (in minutes) for the month of April go from arriving early if you’re flying out of the continental U.S. to Hawaii or Alaska to an aggregate total delay for most big airlines. Note especially that we can visualize the result using matplotlib directly on the driver program, app.py:  </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Y0pygPjEUNs/VTJddlh9IfI/AAAAAAAACTQ/_LKZZPXV9Wk/s1600/delays_large.png\"></p>\n<p>So what is this code doing? Let’s look particularly at the main function which does the work most directly related to Spark. First, we load up a CSV file into an RDD, then map the split function to it. The split function parses each line of text using the csv module and returns a tuple that represents the row. Finally we pass the collect action to the RDD, which brings the data from the RDD back to the driver as a Python list. In this case, airlines.csv is a small jump table that will allow us to join airline codes with the airline full name. We will store this jump table as a Python dictionary and then broadcast it to every node in the cluster using sc.broadcast.</p>\n<p>Next, the main function loads the much larger flights.csv. After splitting the CSV rows, we map the parse function to the CSV row, which converts dates and times to Python dates and times, and casts floating point numbers appropriately. It also stores the row as a NamedTuple called Flight for efficient ease of use.</p>\n<p>With an RDD of Flight objects in hand, we map an anonymous function that transforms the RDD to a series of key-value pairs where the key is the name of the airline and the value is the sum of the arrival and departure delays. Each airline has its delay summed together using the reduceByKey action and the add operator, and this RDD is collected back to the driver (again the number airlines in the data is relatively small). Finally the delays are sorted in ascending order, then the output is printed to the console as well as visualized using matplotlib.</p>\n<p>This example is kind of long, but hopefully it illustrates the interplay of the cluster and the driver program (sending out for analytics, then bringing results back to the driver) as well as the role of Python code in a Spark application.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Although far from a complete introduction to Spark, we hope that you have a better feel for what Spark is, and how to conduct fast, in-memory distributed computing with Python. At the very least, you should be able to get Spark up and running and start exploring data either on your local machine in stand alone mode or via Amazon EC2. You should even be able to get iPython notebook set up and configured to run Spark!</p>\n<p>Spark doesn’t solve the distributed storage problem (usually Spark gets its data from HDFS), but it does provide a rich functional programming API for distributed computation. This framework is built upon the idea of resilient distributed datasets or “RDDs” for short. RDDs are a programming abstraction that represents a partitioned collection of objects, allowing for distributed operations to be performed upon them. RDDs are fault-tolerant (the resilient part) and, most importantly, can be stored in memory on worker nodes for immediate reuse. In memory storage provides for faster and more easily expressed iterative algorithms as well as enabling real-time interactive analyses.</p>\n<p>Because the Spark library has an API available in Python, Scala, and Java, as well as built-in modules for machine learning, streaming data, graph algorithms, and SQL-like queries; it has rapidly become one of the most important distributed computation frameworks that exists today. When coupled with YARN, Spark serves to augment not replace existing Hadoop clusters and will be an important part of Big Data in the future, opening up new avenues of data science exploration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"helpful-links\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#helpful-links\" aria-label=\"helpful links permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Helpful Links</h2>\n<p>Hopefully you’ve enjoyed this post!
