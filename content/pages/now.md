# Working

I'm work for Fossil. Data Team leader. 
My team is looking for 
[Sr Data Engineer](https://sites.google.com/fossil.com/fossil-vietnam/careers/jobs#h.7o4iknl1nehi) too.

# Learning

I feeling in love with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). 
I'm learning Rust to build a high-performance, high-quality, 
and high-reliability Data Platform and Data Services.

My Rust hobby projects working on:

- [grant-rs](https://github.com/duyet/grant-rs): Manage Redshift/Postgres privileges in GitOps style written in Rust
- [glossary-rs](https://github.com/duyet/glossary-rs): Glossary API Service written in Rust, powered by actix.rs and diesel.rs.
- Data Platform (experimental).

I also "try" to learn Data Structure and Algorithm (again). 
But still not. I'm lazy. 
Hopefully I'll learn it someday.

# Reading

I’m reading again.
I’ve hardly read anything in the last few years due to hardwork.

Suggest me something.
