Data Engineer @ Fossil


Studying Master of Computer Science, I've been a Data Engineer @ [John Von Neumann Institute](http://jvn.edu.vn/) (2016-2018). Currently, Data Engineer @ Fossil.

Being a [Data Engineer](/tag/data-engineer/) with 4+ years of experience, I’m currently working for Fossil Group with a Terabyte-scale Data
Platform based on Kubernetes. I am confident in my knowledge of data engineering concepts as well as best practices
and also familiarity with state-of-the-art data and cloud technologies
